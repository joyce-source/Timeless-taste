            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>4 cups vegetable broth</li>
            <li>1 cup coconut milk</li>

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>

            <li>Let the soup simmer for another 5-10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
